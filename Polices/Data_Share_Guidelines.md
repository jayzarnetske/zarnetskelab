## Zarnetske Lab Data Sharing Guidelines


### Access to shared lab GitHub repository


* The lab GitHub hosts data and code for projects done in the lab to make our work as transparent and reproducible as possible.
* A lab GitHub account should be created and administered by the principal investigator of the lab, Jay Zarnetske. Lab members should be added as collaborators to the shared GitHub repository.
 
### Scope and content of the lab GitHub repository


* The shared lab GitHub repository is used to host data, code, and associated documentation for completed projects. Materials associated with published work or data/code product of common interest to the lab should be uploaded to the lab repository. Work in progress does not need to be hosted in the lab GitHub repository.
Group consensus was to do more local development, but then to push/store more final products when ready to share/report out.
* DOI is not easily available for data hosted in GitHub. Other data hosting services, e.g., Figshare or Hydroshare, can be used. But a copy of the data/code should be available in the lab GitHub repository. When using other data sharing service, Jay should be listed as a collaborator or co-owner.
* The lead of a project is responsible to upload all relevant files to the lab GitHub repository once the project is completed. Leads can change but changes must be documented in the project readme file as noted below.
* Each completed project should have a folder with a name that easily identifies the project.
* The project folder should contain data and code that makes the work fully reproducible. Project folder should contain a README file that provide 1) the title of the project, 2) the contact information of the project lead, 3) a brief description/abstract of the project, 4) links to published papers (if applicable), 5) a list of files in the folder and brief descriptions of the purpose and function of each file.
* Names of files within a project folder should be short and descriptive. Avoid using special characters or spaces in file names.
* Data should be stored in non-proprietary format. If data are retrieved from external sources, a link to the data source should be provided.
* Data should be accompanied by metadata.
* Code should be well-commented.
* Code should be complete and fully executable. If a code requires substantial running time to complete, the result of the code, e.g. R workspace, should be provided.
